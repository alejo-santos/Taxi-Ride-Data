Title: Analyzing Taxi Ride Data in Chicago: A Comprehensive Exploration

In this project, we undertake an extensive investigation into taxi ride data in Chicago, with a specific focus on the period spanning November 15-16, 2017. Armed with multiple datasets, we gain valuable insights into various facets of taxi services within the city.

Our analytical journey commences with exploratory data analysis (EDA), where we delve deep into the characteristics of taxi companies and neighborhoods. During this phase, we meticulously identify patterns and trends that shape the taxi landscape. Subsequently, we transition to hypothesis testing, aiming to uncover whether weather conditionsâ€”particularly rainy Saturdaysâ€”affect the average ride duration from the Loop to Oâ€™Hare International Airport.

Our methodology centers around Python programming, leveraging powerful tools such as data visualization and statistical techniques. By rigorously analyzing the data and testing hypotheses, we strive to draw meaningful conclusions that illuminate the dynamics of taxi services in Chicago.

Join us on this analytical expedition as we unveil the subtle nuances of Chicagoâ€™s taxi ecosystem. ðŸš–ðŸŒ†
